this is just a trial of how to commit in intellij to git

Git in IntelliJ:
- From the top menu find the VCS option. ïƒ¨Click Enable Version Control Integration
- Select the git option from the pop-up window
* It will automatically create a git repository for your project
? Which kind of repository?
- Where it said VSC before should now say Git and have some new options
- Your files will get some coloring, this is normal
- Red: file is un-versioned
- Green: actively changed and ready to be part of a repository
