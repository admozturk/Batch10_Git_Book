Flow of a new project:
• Create a local repository
           The hidden. git folder would be made to keep track of changes
• Create a file / Update file
           Make a file with some information or update an existing file
• Commit the changes
          Commit to the local repository with a proper (make it understandable) commit message
• Link / Push to remote repository
          Connect to a GitHub repository and push the changes
Not: Each project has its own special repository.
